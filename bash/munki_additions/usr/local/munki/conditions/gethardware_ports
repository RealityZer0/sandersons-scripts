# Make sure we're outputting our information to "ConditionalItems.plist" (plist is left off since defaults requires this)

IFS=$'\n' # Set our field spearator to newline since each unique item is on its own line
for hardware_port in "$(networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk -F ": " '/Hardware Port/{print $2}')"; do
	# build array of values from output of above command
	hardware_ports+=( $hardware_port )
done

# Note the key "hardware_ports" which becomes the condition that you would use in a predicate statement
defaults write "$plist_loc" "hardware_ports" -array "${hardware_ports[@]}"

# CRITICAL! Since 'defaults' outputs a binary plist, we need to ensure that munki can read it by converting it to xml
plutil -convert xml1 "$plist_loc".plist
